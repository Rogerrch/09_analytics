      <h1>What is Levant?</h1>
      <p>
        Levant® is a low profile ventilation system that is designed to wick
        moisture away from the bottom of your mattress preventing the invasion
        of mold colonies in mattress. <br />
        High end mattresses are expensive and porn to mold damage, particularly
        in humid environments. Once the mold is in the mattress it’s imposable
        to remove it. Mold spores have been linked to 
        <a class="hLink"

        including Asthma and COPD to name a few.

        People spend about one third of their life in bed, Quality of sleep it
        closely tied to quality of life, health and longevity. Because of this
        fact many people are willing to make a significant investment in a good
        mattress and sleep system. Unfortunately many of these sleep systems
        don’t account for use in a humid environment. Most

          target="_blank"
          >Mattresses warranties
        </a>
        are voided by water or moisture related damage. A few third party
        companies have filled this gap buy making moisture resistant barriers
        covers that cover the top of the mattress, targeting the accidental
        spill of liquids on the top of the bed. This does nothing for the
        condensation that builds up under the mattress when it sits on a solid
        surface that lacks sufficient ventilation. This is a frustrating and
        unhealthy an expense for a consumer particularly when they find out
        their warranty has limited protection.

        This problem can be avoided by making sure there is a good air flow
        across the bottom of the matters and consistently managing humidity
        levels in the room. Proper airflow allows the excess moisture to
        evaporate rather than saturate the porous surface of the bed. Humid
        locations must be very diligent in controlling moisture in the home to
        avoid mildew and mold. Even the latent heat from a warm shower can
        saturate the air and put your bed at risk, it only takes one carless
        incident to give mold an opportunity to invade your mattress.
        Unfortunately many bed foundations that are made to be attractive and
        physically support mattresses only encourage the mold to grow. Untreated
        and even most treated wood can harbor mold spoors

          target="_blank"
          >wood can harbor mold spoors</a
        >. Solid surfaces are less permeable then the surface of the mattress so
        if moisture dose get trapped between the hard surface and the mattress
        it will collect in the mattress and without ventilation is will stay
        there. Metal platforms are not ideal either as they can encourage the
        phenomena know as

        </a>
        where saturated air condenses when it comes in contact with a cool
        surface like metal. Traditional box springs do allow ventilation, but
        many people don’t want to add an additional 3-5 inches of height to a
        luxurious 15in thick mattress. Many people are also opting for
        adjustable

        for their mattresses, unfortunately these foundation are soiled surfaces
        for the sake of strength and can’t provide adequate ventilation to
        evacuate the moisture associate with

        I spent 2015 working for as a sales associate for furniture store,
        selling mattresses and bed systems were my primary focus. I came to find
        that good sleep was rare and people are wanting more hours of good
        quality sleep. I got to hear multiple horror stories of how their
        present mattresses were affecting their lives in negative ways. I also
        had to deal with customers who ultimately weren’t satisfied with their
        purchases. I sympathized it’s horrible to feel like you have been
        cheated or lied too when a purchase fails to meet your needs.
        Unfortunately with mattresses I couldn’t do much to help them because of
        return policies regarding bedding and because warranties issues are
        addressed by the manufacturer. But being familiar with the limitations I
        was better able to recommend care and prevention methods to protect
        their health and investment. I would often hear about
        <a class="hLink"
          href="https://www.choosemattress.com/mold-on-mattresses/"
          target="_blank"
          >mold issues
        </a>
        from other regions in the company and wondered why it was happening and
        what could be done to safe guard my customers against the potential
        hazards of humid environments to their furniture. That’s when I first
        had the idea for Levant® having bought a high end sleep system myself
        with a thick foam matters and an adjustable base it has given me more
        opportunity to consider the design and benefits of a ventilation system
        between the mattress and it’s platform.

        Levant® uses a three phase
        protection system to repel moisture, microbes, spores, and pests from
        your sleeping area keeping it healthy. Also Levant® has a ventilation
        network formed into a inch thick pad of firm compost felt that encourages
        air flow and evaporation. Felt is compressed wool. The

        is added to help with moisture control as well as its ability to absorb
        odder keeping the area fresh. Silica gel is present also. Like charcoal
        it also has a great capacity to capture moisture and odder. The addition
        of cedar fibers woven into the core is also beneficial as it is a
        natural repelent for pests and incests.

        Felt is also firm enough to support the weight of a mattress and person
        without compressing the internal vents of the mat. But its flexible
        enough that is can conform to the positions created by the adjustable
        base platform. To make the product more attractive and to add additional
        protection from insects the pad would be incased in an attractive,
        breathable sleeve. That would have a few strategic rubberized pads to
        prevent Levant® from sliding during the deformation of the adjustable
        base. Levant® is also light and portable and flexible unlike a box
        spring it can and should be taken to be steam cleaned at least once a
        year. <br />Consumers who buy premium sleep systems are interested in
        protecting their health and improving their quality of life. For many it
        represents a significant expenditure and sacrifice but they are
        confident that the features of the new bed and platform will benefit
        their sleep and their health. Along that same line if educated they will
        also want to protect their investment and the products
